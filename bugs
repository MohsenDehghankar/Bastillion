						saving file before and after change
						not save all content of large files )

2. one may change authorized_keys and disconnect the server  ( solution ==> 
						when entering "authorizd_key", "ssh config file" in commands logout the admin (not manager)
						while uploading check "authorized_key", "ssh config file" in file content )
						
3. log from pushed files => save file and rename it and print name and destination path in log
