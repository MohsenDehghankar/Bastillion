1. SSH key generation only available for Managers. (when having private-key, one can generate his own keys (??) and add to server)
    * creating a predefined script to check /.ssh/authorized_keys
    . set authorized key refresh interval some minutes

2. Save Terminal Sessions => can use profiles

3. Logs : a. from audit sessions in managers profile
          b. in file log4j2.xml, logs are in /var/log/bastillion-* ( uncommenting log4j2.xml => logs in console )
          c. testing database at DBUtils.java ("database testing")
          session_log, terminal_log

          logs:
            auth logs
            update authorized_keys
            audit sessions logs
            (every where there is a logger)

4. get logs and convert to syslog send to udp

5. test performance on vm with many ssh servers

6. for update:
        git fetch upstream
        git rebase upstream/master
        git push origin master (--force)

7. authorized_keys => ***cleans the authorized_keys file.
    .overwrites on each ssh connection
    .also key management interval can be set, i.e. after every 1 minutes updates authorized_keys (deletes what added manually)(the keys added in bastillion will remain)
    .sshutils 377

8. how opens ssh session
